# weather-station-hub

Weather station hub is a project carried out as a way to learn more about Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, Docker and microservices in general. The idea is to have a hub that receives data from different weather stations (data-gen module which simulates data) and stores it in a database. The data is then made available through a REST API.

## Setup

`docker compose up -d`

That should be it.
